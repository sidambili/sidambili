Hey, I’m Sid.

I build AI systems for real businesses. Mostly voice agents, internal tools, and the infrastructure behind them.

Right now my focus is making sure these systems work in the real world. Messy data, edge cases, people talking over each other, bad inputs, long calls, and teams that don’t want to think about “AI” at all.

## What I’m working on

### Uobo
This is my main project.

Uobo builds AI voice agents used by car dealerships today. The agents handle real calls, capture structured information, and plug into dealership workflows.

We’re also building a Service Ops platform on top of this. The goal is simple:  
make service workflows clearer, reduce back and forth, and turn conversations into usable reporting for advisors and managers.

This is where most of my time goes.

### Syntreon
Syntreon is the underlying platform behind Uobo.

It handles the less visible but critical stuff:
- call ingestion and processing  
- evaluations and scoring  
- multi-tenant data separation  
- analytics and reporting layers  

Think of it as the infrastructure and intelligence layer that products like Uobo sit on top of.

## Open source / side projects

### PromptManager
An open-source prompt management tool I started as an internal project.

I was tired of prompts living in random docs and Notion pages. This treats prompts more like code:
- version history  
- forking  
- reusable variables  
- private or public libraries  

It’s intentionally simple and self-hostable. Built for builders who actually write and reuse prompts.

## What I’m learning right now

- AI evaluations and scoring (what “good” actually means)
- system design for multi-tenant products
- Kubernetes basics
- how to build and test AI systems without burning compute
- making AI outputs more predictable and debuggable

## How I like to build

I’m not chasing hype.

I care more about:
- things working at 2am  
- clear data boundaries  
- boring, readable systems  
- shipping something useful, then improving it  

If a system can’t be explained simply, it’s probably not ready yet.

Always building. Always breaking things and fixing them.
