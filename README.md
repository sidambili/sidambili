<h2>Hey, I’m Sid</h2>

<p>
I work on AI voice agents and internal software used by car dealerships.<br/>
Most of what I build sits behind the scenes and deals with real workflows, real calls, and real edge cases. <br/>
Also working on my first open source project for a prompt management tool.

<h3>🚗 Uobo</h3>

<p>
My main project.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI voice agents currently used by car dealerships</li>
  <li>Handles inbound calls and captures structured service information</li>
  <li>Building a Service Ops platform to improve service workflows and reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is where most of my time goes.

<h3>🧠 Syntreon</h3>

<p>
The platform behind Uobo.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Call ingestion and processing</li>
  <li>AI evaluations and scoring</li>
  <li>Multi-tenant data separation</li>
  <li>Analytics and reporting layers</li>
</ul>

<p>
It handles the infrastructure so products like Uobo can stay focused on the user.

<h3>🛠 Open source</h3>

  <li>Private or public libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>📚 Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>AI evaluations and scoring</li>
  <li>System design for multi-tenant products</li>

  <li>Building and testing AI systems with low compute</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧩 How I like to build</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Systems that work at odd hours without babysitting</li>
  <li>Clear data boundaries</li>
  <li>Readable, boring code</li>
  <li>Ship first, then improve</li>
</ul>

<p>
If something can’t be explained simply, it probably isn’t ready.
